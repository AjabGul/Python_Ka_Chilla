# Variables
# Variables are containers for storing data values.
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)


# Casting
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

a = str(3)    # x will be '3'
b = int(3)    # y will be 3
c = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

print(a)
print(type(a))
print(b)
print(type(b))
print(c)
print(type(c))

# Get the Type
# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

print(type(x))
print(type(y))

# Variable Names Rules:
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
