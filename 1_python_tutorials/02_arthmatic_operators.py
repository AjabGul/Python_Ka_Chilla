# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# 1-Arithmetic operators
# 2-Assignment operators
# 3-Comparison operators
# 4-Logical operators
# 5-Identity operators
# 6-Membership operators
# 7-Bitwise operators

# 1- Arithmetic operators: (Note: Python follow the PEMDAS formula)

# 1.1- addtion
print(5+6)
# 1.2- substruction
print(10-5)
# 1.3- multifilcation
print(5*6)
# 1.4- division (flot number give number in points)
print(12/5)
# 1.4- division ansewr in whol number not flot
print(13//5)
# 1.5- modulus
print(13 % 5)
# 1.6- exponentiation
print(5**2)
